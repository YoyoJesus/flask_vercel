        <h1 class="mt-4">About Me</h1>
        <p>Hey, I'm Austin! I'm a Computer Science sophomore at Kent State, focusing on cybersecurity with a minor in Computer Engineering Technology. I like breaking things (ethically) and figuring out how to make them more secure.</p>
        
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><strong>🔒 Cybersecurity & Hacking:</strong> I'm diving deep into penetration testing, ethical hacking, and secure coding practices. I love figuring out vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.</li>
            <li><strong>🤖 Robotics & Engineering:</strong> I’m heavily involved in combat robotics, where I help build, maintain, and (occasionally) fix bots that take a serious beating.</li>
            <li><strong>🖥️ Tech & Programming:</strong> I’ve worked on projects ranging from web development to machine learning and VR-based motion sickness research. Whether it's coding or hardware, I'm always up for a challenge.</li>
            <li><strong>🎲 Gaming & D&D:</strong> When I’m not messing with code, I’m probably playing Dungeons & Dragons, playing <i>Hearts of Iron</i>, or getting lost in sci-fi and dystopian worlds.</li>
            <li><strong>📡 Networking & IT:</strong> I work as an IT Assistant, helping maintain networks and troubleshoot hardware issues. Summer jobs in IT have given me hands-on experience with real-world tech problems.</li>
            <li><strong>🚀 Future Goals:</strong> My ultimate goal is to work in penetration testing, finding and fixing security flaws before they become real threats. I want to be on the front lines of cybersecurity, making the digital world safer.</li>
        </ul>
