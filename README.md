## Testing running a web application built in flask on the vercel infrastructure
I have been playing with vercel for a few projects, and also experience running vercel for my personal website, along with a club website.
I was curious to see if there was a way to connect the two. I also would like to see how vercel's db functionality could tie into something like this.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel dev
```

Your Flask application is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.
